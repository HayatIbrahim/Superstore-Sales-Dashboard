# Superstore-Sales-Dashboard
I’ve just finished my Excel-based Superstore Sales Dashboard project. It’s a comprehensive tool that provides clear insights into business performance and helps identify growth opportunities. The dashboard is divided into three pages: Revenue Analysis, Top and Bottom Analysis, and Profit Analysis, each offering a detailed breakdown of key metrics and trends to help drive informed decision-making.
Key Metrics:
Revenue, Profit, Profit Margin, Total Quantity Sold, and COGS: These KPIs provide a clear snapshot of the business performance. By including both revenue and profit margins, you allow the business to gauge not only top-line growth but also operational efficiency.
Top Performers:
Geographical & Product Segments:
USA and New York lead in revenue, which aligns with their large market size and consumer base.
Technology as the top category and Consumer as the leading segment indicate a demand for tech products, particularly among everyday consumers.
Daily Revenue Trends:
The daily revenue column chart showcases a clear difference between weekdays and weekends:
Fridays emerge as the top-performing day, possibly due to consumer behavior leading into the weekend.
Sundays show minimal sales, potentially reflecting lower customer activity.
The striking 905.78% growth rate on Mondays reflects the sharp rebound from low Sunday sales, suggesting that Monday may act as a recovery day in terms of sales activity.
Conversely, Saturday’s -40.29% drop highlights the volatility around weekends, perhaps following Friday's sales surge.
Monthly Growth (MOM%):
The line chart reveals:
August’s 72.6% growth rate stands out, indicating a seasonal spike or a successful promotional period.
Dips in February, July, and October could reflect lower demand periods or missed opportunities for promotional activities.
November and December are strong sales months, possibly due to holiday shopping patterns, making them key periods for strategic planning.
Quarterly Analysis:
Q4 is the strongest quarter, often driven by holiday sales and end-of-year purchases.
Q2 shows a remarkable 23.55% growth rate, mainly due to its recovery from the slower Q1. This highlights an upward trend that builds momentum into Q3 and Q4.
Overall Insights:
The dashboard efficiently captures key trends and allows stakeholders to quickly identify top performers, sales growth opportunities, and underperforming periods. The mix of charts (column and line charts) adds clarity, helping users visualize daily, monthly, and quarterly patterns, as well as pinpoint areas for deeper analysis.
In the Profit Analysis section of my dashboard, I’ve used different column and bar charts. One key chart shows profit by region and market, where I included an option button to switch between the two. The Central region leads in profit, while the APAC market tops the market segment. I also included a column chart for monthly profit by quarter, with the last quarter performing the best. Finally, I analyzed daily profit by....
